# Krogger - Crossy road / Frogger clone made by Me (@Myggski) and Daniel (@harofax)
This project was made for the **Game programming with C#** class at **FutureGames**

It has it's own API to save highscore with the help of an external [API](https://github.com/Myggski/krogger-highscore-api) that uses Firebase.
