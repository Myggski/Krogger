# Krogger - Crossy road / Frogger clone
This project was made for the **Game programming with C#** class at **FutureGames**

It has it's own API to save highscore with the help of an external [API](https://github.com/Myggski/krogger-highscore-api) that uses Firebase.

The project was made in Unity by Tomas Wallin ([@myggski](https://github.com/Myggski)) and Daniel Khodarahmi ([@harofax](https://github.com/harofax))
