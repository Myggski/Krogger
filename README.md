# Krogger
This is a Crossy road / Frogger clone that was made for the course **Game programming with C#** at [**FutureGames**](http://futuregames.se/).

## API
Krogger uses a custom made API made in NodeJS to store high scores in Firebase. 
You can find the API project [here](https://github.com/Myggski/krogger-highscore-api).

The project was made in Unity by Tomas Wallin ([@myggski](https://github.com/Myggski)) and Daniel Khodarahmi ([@harofax](https://github.com/harofax)).
